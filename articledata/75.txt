According to a video from 2016, embattled Fresno State Professor Randa Jarrar laments the fact that progressives no longer utilize terrorist acts like hijacking planes.
Barbara Bush was a generous and smart and amazing racist who, along with her husband, raised a war criminal. F**k outta here with your nice words, Jarrar tweeted earlier this week. In a separate tweet, Jarrar said that the news made her happy becauseBarbara Bushs death likely made George W. Bush upset. Additionally, Jarrar clogged a mental health crisis hotline when she jokingly tweeted the hotlines number out to her critics, pretending that it was her personal number.
In a video surfacing from 2016, Jarrar lamented the state of progressive activism before speaking fondly of Palestinian plane hijackers.
Im tired of being the bigger person. Im tired of the left being fucking stupid and being like we have to be gentle. No, dont be fucking gentle, Jarrar said.
You look at resistance fighters in the 60s and 70s, they didnt kill anyone, but they scared the shit out of people. They would hijack a plane and be like we arent going to hurt anyone on this plane, but we are going to fucking hijack this plane, Jarrar continued.
The guy who walked between the twin towers is amazing. The only reason hes important is because the [twin towers] arent there anymore, Jarrar added.
Im tired of being nice. Im tired of seeing my white friends on the left writing postcards, she finished. Fuck your postcards. Thats enough. Fucking get out there and do some shit.
