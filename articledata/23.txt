University of Kentucky head basketball coach John Calipari said he met with the National Basketball Players Association to discuss ending the one-and-done rule and creating a combine for high school juniors to begin assessing their future.
On Friday, Mac Engel of the Star-Telegram provided comments from Calipari, who explained the focus should be on putting less "restrictions on kids."
"The players and the families need to knowhere are the ones who should be thinking about the NBA, and here are the ones who should not," he said. "That's why you need a combine."
Calipari, who's also coached at the NBA and international levels, said every option should be made available to high school players rather than just a narrow path to the professional ranks, per Engel.
"If they want to go out of high school, go. If they want to go to college and then leave, let them leave when they want to leave," he said. "Why would we force a kid to stay? 'Wellit's good for the game?' It's about these kids and their families. Because let me tell you, if we [abolish one-and-done], the kids that do come to college will stay for two to three years."
In February, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters he was "conflicted" about whether to abolish the one-and-done rule. He noted the reasons go beyond simply whether there are players talented enough to make the jump from high school to the NBA.
Silver explained the league office believes the draft is better when teams have a year to evaluate players outside of high school. In addition, he's been told "don't forget the vets" regarding the potential for older players to lose their roster spots to raw prospects.
"So we've had some meetings with the player's association where we've shared datasuccess rates of young players coming into the league," he said. "We've talked a lot about youth development, in terms of whether we should be getting involved with some of these young players even earlier than when they come into college."
One alternative is going straight to the G League, where prospects can earn a salary and focus solely on basketball development for one year before entering the draft.
Silver hasn't provided a timetable for a final decision about the one-and-done rule, though.
