The National Football League is down to just its final McCown.
While 38-year-old Josh still toils under center for the New York Jets , his younger brother, Luke McCown , is calling it quits.
The 36-year-old career backup passer announced his retirement Friday, sending a statement out through his agent, Mike McCartney:
Congrats @LukeMcCown ! Proud to have been through this journey with you! pic.twitter.com/A01C1mQsvC

McCown entered the NFL as a fourth-round pick of the Browns in 2004, making four winless starts as a rookie for Cleveland in the post-Tim Couch era.
He's made just six starts since, logging three with the Buccaneers in 2007, two with the Jaguars in 2011 and one final start with the Saints -- against the Panthers -- in 2015.
McCown's final stop in the league came last summer with the Cowboys , but Dallas released him before the start of the season. With scant interest on the open market, Luke is moving on to new horizons.
We wish him well.
