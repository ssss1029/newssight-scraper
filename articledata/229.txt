The problem was, while The Adventures of Superpup might not be a particularly bad idea for an animated series, it wasnt at all conducive to a live-action show on a limited budget. The show saved money by reusing the sets from The Adventures of Superman, but the little people actors were still forced to wear cheap mascot heads with limited (if any) articulation, and to say that the overall effect is off-putting would be very, very kind.
At best, its innocently surreal. At worst, its eerily hallucinogenic. Of course, given how inexpensive the pilot episode for The Adventures of Superpup was, its quite likely that - if the series had been picked up - the producers would have eventually spent more money on the costumes and made them somewhat less creepy. Then again, this kind of clunky, dead-eyed mascot costume is still occasionally used in childrens entertainment today, so there were absolutely no guarantees that the costumes would have improved enough to make a difference.
As a story, The Adventures of Superpup was a straightforward riff on the more successful Superman show. Bark Bent and Pamela Poodle work for The Daily Bugle (which sounds like a Spider-Man reference but it isnt, since Spider-Man wouldnt be created for another four years). Together they get called into the office of their editor, Terry Bite, to celebrate the successful capture of the villainous Professor Sheepdip, who will (of course) never get out of jail. Then we cut to the jail, where Professor Sheepdip immediately escapes with the aid of his dopey sidekick Wolfingham (Sadie Delfino).
Afterwards, Sergeant Beagle (Frank Delfino) stops by the Daily Bugle to apologize? Does he work for the newspaper? Its all very confusing, but anyway, after that, Professor Sheepdip tries to blow up the building by putting Wolfingham in a giant clock and delivering it to Terry Bites office. Superpup throws half of the editors belongings out of the window before he realizes the clock is the bomb, so he flies it away, and drops it on Professor Sheepdips house.
Superpup saves the day, but Professor Sheepdip is still at large, so in the second half of the episode the mad genius kidnaps Pamela Poodle and straps her on a rocket to the moon. Superpup puts a stop to that as well, and the rocket blows up Professor Sheepdip and Wolfinghams car instead. The show closes with a shameless voice-over pitch: Be with us again next week, when YOUR PRODUCT, the best of its kind in the world, presents The Adventures of Superpup!
Flattery got them nowhere, of course. The show didnt attract interest and never officially aired on television, although it did wind up on some home video collections, and is now a special feature on the comprehensive Superman Motion Picture Anthology Blu-ray movie collection, released by Warner Bros. in 2011. The pilot was filmed in color, but approximately half the episode only exists in black-and-white today, so many recordings of the show flip back and forth throughout the episode.
Is it any good? Well, the humor is slapstick and, by todays standards, not particularly funny, but its important to remember that The Adventures of Superpup was being produced for very young children. It is, if nothing else, a fast-paced piece of absurdist entertainment. If only the heads of the costumes were a little more adorable, and a little less like something youd expect to find in the deleted scenes of a David Lynch movie, it would have been a completely affable, albeit forgettable, footnote in Supermans history.
It has been suggested, over the years, that The Adventures of Superpup was produced as a response to the tragic and mysterious death of Superman star George Reeves, but there seems to be little truth to that urban legend. Reeves died in June 16, 1959 and the copyright information on the Adventures of Superpup title card clearly reads 1958 (in roman numerals). So it would appear that this show was merely a failed, ill-advised spinoff, as opposed to some desperate last-minute attempt to keep the franchise afloat.
Although it wasnt a success, a show like The Adventures of Superpup does, in a roundabout way, prove just how successful Superman truly is. While we celebrate the many successful and unforgettable comic books, movies and television shows that have been made about the character, the fact that Superman can also transform into something as strange The Adventures of Superpup and then back again, as successful ever, is a testament to the heros versatility.

\r\nBatman Begins solved this problem by revealing Joe Chill as the killer but then robbing Bruce of the chance to take revenge, as Chill is gunned down by a Falcone mob enforcer before Bruce himself can pull the trigger. This leaves Bruce both unfulfilled and ashamed of his actions, elements that figure heavily into his decision to leave Gotham and become the Batman.","height":787,"width":1399,"url":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/joe-chill-1519706610225.jpg","styleUrl":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/joe-chill-1519706610225_{size}.jpg","credit":"","objectRelationName":"","objectRelationUrl":"","albumName":"How DC\u0027s Movies Have Improved on the Comics","relativePosition":"02","albumTotalCount":13},{"caption":"The Krypton of DC\u0027s classic Superman comics is a very colorful place. If anything, Superman\u0027s own superhero costume is pretty restrained by Kryptonian standards. But what plays well on the page of a Silver Age comic doesn\u0027t necessarily translate to a big-budget superhero film. 1978\u0027s Superman addressed this by bringing a whole new look to Krypton and its people. The crystalline architecture and simple fashion designs highlighted the idea of Krypton being an austere, remote civilization brought down by its own hubris. These designs have proven so influential that they\u0027ve worked their way into Superman stories across all media.

But Batman Begins found a better outcome by instead connecting the rise of Batman to Ra\u0027s al Ghul. The film re-imagined Ra\u0027s as a fatherly mentor to a directionless Bruce Wayne, adding greater emotional weight when the two had their inevitable falling out... and burned down each other\u0027s houses.","height":640,"width":1136,"url":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/ras-al-ghul-1519706610231.jpg","styleUrl":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/ras-al-ghul-1519706610231_{size}.jpg","credit":"","objectRelationName":"","objectRelationUrl":"","albumName":"How DC\u0027s Movies Have Improved on the Comics","relativePosition":"04","albumTotalCount":13},{"caption":"In general, 2013\u0027s Man of Steel made a lot of mistakes when it came to updating Superman\u0027s mythology. But one thing it did well was to cut right to the chase in terms of Superman and Lois Lane\u0027s romance. By the time Clark Kent actually joined the Daily Planet, Lois was already in on his big secret. By Batman v. Superman, the two were living together. Unlike the comics, this Superman isn\u0027t as uptight about maintaining a secret identity, especially when it comes to those closest to him.","height":600,"width":1067,"url":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/lois--clark-1519706610229.jpg","styleUrl":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/lois--clark-1519706610229_{size}.jpg","credit":"","objectRelationName":"","objectRelationUrl":"","albumName":"How DC\u0027s Movies Have Improved on the Comics","relativePosition":"05","albumTotalCount":13},{"caption":"It can be difficult to add compelling new villains to Batman\u0027s overflowing rogues gallery, but that was never a problem for Batman: The Animated Series. Hot on the heels of giving the world Harley Quinn, the series introduced another great, tragic villain in the theatrical spinoff Batman: Mask of The Phantasm. The film gave us Andrea Beaumont, a blast from Bruce Wayne\u0027s past who proved every bit as memorable as her former lover.","height":900,"width":1600,"url":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/phantasm-1519706610230.jpg","styleUrl":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/phantasm-1519706610230_{size}.jpg","credit":"","objectRelationName":"","objectRelationUrl":"","albumName":"How DC\u0027s Movies Have Improved on the Comics","relativePosition":"06","albumTotalCount":13},{"caption":"Sometimes, superhero movies redefine a character so utterly that even the comics have to follow suit. That was the case when Superman: The Movie and Superman II introduced General Zod to a wider audience. Terence Stamp\u0027s portrayal of the proud, haughty villain has become the standard by which all others are judged, and the phrase \u0022Kneel before Zod\u0022 is now a part of the pop culture lexicon.","height":652,"width":1160,"url":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/general-zod-1519706610221.jpg","styleUrl":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/general-zod-1519706610221_{size}.jpg","credit":"","objectRelationName":"","objectRelationUrl":"","albumName":"How DC\u0027s Movies Have Improved on the Comics","relativePosition":"07","albumTotalCount":13},{"caption":"This is a minor change, but one that\u0027s appreciated all the same. In most versions of Two-Face\u0027s origin story, it\u0027s never really explained how Harvey Dent can be scarred in such a perfectly symmetrical fashion. The Dark Knight offered a logical explanation by showing Harvey lying half-submerged in a pool of gasoline moments before being doused in flame. Once again, Christopher Nolan found a way to make one of the crazier elements of the Batman mythos work in the context of his more grounded universe.","height":817,"width":1453,"url":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/two-face-1519706610239.jpg","styleUrl":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/two-face-1519706610239_{size}.jpg","credit":"","objectRelationName":"","objectRelationUrl":"","albumName":"How DC\u0027s Movies Have Improved on the Comics","relativePosition":"08","albumTotalCount":13},{"caption":"Batman v. Superman established that, as far as DCEU continuity goes, Wayne Manor has long been empty and abandoned. Justice League offered a nice little follow-up to that reveal by having Bruce finally reopen his old mansion - not as a home for a lonely, antisocial billionaire, but as headquarters for the Justice League. That twist highlighted Batman\u0027s character growth over the course of the two films and paid homage to the beloved Hall of Justice from the Super Friends cartoon.","height":627,"width":1116,"url":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/wayne-manor-1519706610241.jpg","styleUrl":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/wayne-manor-1519706610241_{size}.jpg","credit":"","objectRelationName":"","objectRelationUrl":"","albumName":"How DC\u0027s Movies Have Improved on the Comics","relativePosition":"09","albumTotalCount":13},{"caption":"The LEGO Batman Movie made one significant change to the Batman mythos by introducing Barbara Gordon not as a teenage sidekick to Batman, but rather as the new police commissioner of Gotham City. That significantly altered the dynamic between the two characters, making them peers rather than mentor and pupil. In the process, it served as a reminder that Babs can be a great character even when she doesn\u0027t have a costumed identity.","height":800,"width":1421,"url":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/commissioner-batgirl-1519706610219.jpg","styleUrl":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/commissioner-batgirl-1519706610219_{size}.jpg","credit":"","objectRelationName":"","objectRelationUrl":"","albumName":"How DC\u0027s Movies Have Improved on the Comics","relativePosition":10,"albumTotalCount":13},{"caption":"Historically, Bane seems to be one of the harder Batman villains to get right, with many stories depicting him as a mindless, Venom-addicted brawler rather than the cunning mastermind he was in his early comic book appearances. The Dark Knight Rises finally redeemed the character in live-action, in part by replacing Bane\u0027s trusty super-steroid with a simple analgesic painkiller. By eliminating Bane\u0027s ability to Hulk out and snap Batman like a twig, the film was forced to emphasize his intelligence and fearsome willpower instead.","height":1440,"width":2560,"url":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/bane-1519706610215.jpg","styleUrl":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/bane-1519706610215_{size}.jpg","credit":"","objectRelationName":"","objectRelationUrl":"","albumName":"How DC\u0027s Movies Have Improved on the Comics","relativePosition":11,"albumTotalCount":13},{"caption":"Some superhero fans are quick to dismiss Superman as \u0022The Big Blue Boy Scout,\u0022 a relic from a simpler time. Superman: The Movie actually played that perception to its advantage by making Superman a man out of time a la Captain America. When a teenage Clark Kent discovers the Fortress of Solitude and reconnects with his heritage, it\u0027s a full 12 years before he returns to the outside world. This change further sets Clark apart from the jaded, worn-down people he\u0027s dedicated himself to saving.","height":576,"width":1024,"url":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/superman-time-travel-1519706610238.png","styleUrl":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/superman-time-travel-1519706610238_{size}.png","credit":"","objectRelationName":"","objectRelationUrl":"","albumName":"How DC\u0027s Movies Have Improved on the Comics","relativePosition":12,"albumTotalCount":13},{"caption":"In the DCEU, Superman is a relative newcomer, while Batman has been active for a couple decades. But neither superhero career holds a candle to Wonder Woman\u0027s. As the Wonder Woman solo movie established, Diana first entered the world of men to battle evil at the height of World War I. That makes her one of Earth\u0027s first superheroes and an inspiration to all who came after (whether they realize it or not). We actually prefer that to the traditional approach, where Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman all make their debuts at roughly the same time. Why can\u0027t Diana have the spotlight?","height":1152,"width":2048,"url":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/wonder-woman-1519706610242.jpg","styleUrl":"http:\/\/assets1.ignimgs.com\/2018\/02\/27\/wonder-woman-1519706610242_{size}.jpg","credit":"","objectRelationName":"","objectRelationUrl":"","albumName":"How DC\u0027s Movies Have Improved on the Comics","relativePosition":13,"albumTotalCount":13}]'   data-ads-disabled='false'   data-ad-frequency='5'   data-image-size='1280w'>
