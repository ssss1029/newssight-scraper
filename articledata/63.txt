Apple To Replace Some MacBook Pro Laptops With Swollen Batteries
Apple Inc. said a "limited number" of 13-inch MacBook Pro laptops sold between October 2016 and October 2017 have a potentially faulty component that causes the battery to expand.
The company said this is not a safety issue and it will replace batteries in affected units at no charge. The company posted a
page on its website where customers can check if their laptop is affected and begin the battery exchange process. The issue doesnt affect models with the Touch Bar.
