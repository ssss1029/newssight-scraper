Altogether, the rally enabled the cryptocurrency market cap to climb by more than $25 billion to $373.8 billion  a single-day gain of 7.4 percent.
Bitcoin Price Cracks $8,500
The Bitcoin price trailed the index for the day, but an early morning bounce nevertheless propelled it past the $8,500 threshold to a present value of $8,514 on Bitfinex. Bitcoin now has a $144.5 billion market cap, which translates into a 24-hour increase of three percent.

This movement is largely in line with recent forecasts from Fundstrat Global Advisors and Pantera Capital, each of whom predicted that a reduction in tax-based selling would likely lead to a Bitcoin price bump in the short-term and a new all-time high by the end of the year.
Notably, though, Bitcoin dominance has declined to 38.7 percent, its lowest point since late February.
Ethereum Price Beats the Index
The Ethereum price , meanwhile, managed to beat the index by two full percentage points. The second-largest cryptocurrency rose by nine percent for the day, raising its price to a present value of $589 on Bitfinex. Ethereum now has a $58.1 billion market cap.
