With less than a week remaining before the 2018 NFL draft, former Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson has reportedly secured a spot in the first round.
According to Jordan Raanan of ESPN.com, Jackson is expected to be one of five quarterbacks selected in the top 20, presumably along with Sam Darnold, Josh Rosen, Baker Mayfield and Josh Allen .
Raanan reported that several sources "really like" Jackson heading into the draft.
Bleacher Report's Mike Freeman previously reported the New England Patriots were the team "most interested in Jackson," but they might have to move up in order to get their man. They own the Nos. 23 and 31 picks in the first round.
There seems to be a lot of disagreement about Jackson as a prospect, however.
The 2016 Heisman Trophy winner is also an outstanding runner who notched 4,132 rushing yards and 50 rushing touchdowns in his three years in college, but there is debate about how his passing ability will translate to the NFL.
According to Bleacher Report's Matt Miller , Jackson could be drafted anywhere between Nos. 15 and 40 with the Arizona Cardinals and Los Angeles Chargers appearing to be most likely to take him halfway through the first round.
On the other hand, there is consensus surrounding the other four top quarterbacks in the class, with Darnold, Rosen, Mayfield and Allen potentially coming off the board in the first five picks.
Of course, it will all be a mystery until the first round of the draft Thursday.
