The NRA really doesnt like it when people dont show enough respect to President Donald Trump .
A new spot from the gun lobbyists features an angry guy stewing as a TV shows clips of the media criticizing Trump and the National Rifle Association. Some of the clips are of comedy shows, including  Saturday Night Live  and Last Week Tonight With John Oliver.
Eventually he lowers a set of goggles and destroys the TV set with a sledgehammer in a tantrum as it displays a Morning Joe segment.
The angry guy in the video is right-wing radio host Grant Stinchfield, who made headlines last year when he suggested that North Korea drop a nuclear bomb on Sacramento, California .
He later apologized, saying he was only joking about destroying an American city.
The odd new spot is getting a reaction on Twitter... just probably not the one the gun group was aiming for:
Wait, if I smash my TV, how do I watch NRA TV?

Do the NRA snowflakes need a safe space so big bad words won't hurt their little feelings?
