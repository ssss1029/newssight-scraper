The Fulton County District Attorney said Laguerres co-defendant, Prentice Baker Jr., 28, remained in court.
According to authorities, Laguerre and Baker got into a fight with Hardeman outside his home in southeast Atlanta. They left, but reported and opened fire on Hardeman, the Journal-Constitution reported.
Laguerre and Baker were both found guilty of felony murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and other charges, Fox 5 reported. Both were sentenced to life in prison plus five years.
Hardeman had attended Cal State Fullerton on a football scholarship, the newspaper reported. A knee injury forced him to return to Atlanta, where he took criminal justice classes at Georgia State University and prepared to join the schools football team.
