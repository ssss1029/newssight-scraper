On Thursday AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson took the stand to testify in defense of his company's proposed Time Warner acquisition against antitrust claims . The Justice Department's case is that the combined company could hurt consumers and drive up cable bills, a charge Stephenson called "absurd." However, while on the stand Stephenson Washington Post writer Brian Fung tweets that he did reveal a future product plan for AT&T, a so-called "skinny bundle" that could be the cheapest TV package we've seen at just $15 per month.
Called AT&T Watch, it would ditch sports to keep the price low, and be available for free to the company's wireless subscribers. There's no word on exactly what channels would be included but it's apparently going to launch in the next few weeks. At that price it would be cheaper than AT&T's lowest-price DirecTV Now package ($35 for 60+ channels) and Sling TV's cheapest lineup ($20 for 25+ channels). The only problem, of course, is that these days you can also compare it to choices like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu which can be even cheaper, albeit without live TV options at those prices.
Okay. We have confirmation from AT&T about AT&T Watch. The new product comes WITHOUT sports. It is not a sports-only bundle. #USvATT https://t.co/0PqKUuY0u9
