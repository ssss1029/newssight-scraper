Authorities say an Amish buggy was struck from behind by a pickup truck in Ohio on Friday, killing a woman and critically injuring a man and two infants, according to The Associated Press.
The AP reported the Shelby County Sheriff's Office said the buggy was properly lit when it was struck around 9 p.m. Friday in Sidney, some 75 miles northwest of Columbus.
A 23-year-old woman was pronounced dead at the scene. The infants were flown to a Dayton hospital, while the man was taken to a local medical facility before being transferred to a Dayton hospital.
Sheriff Lt. Tim Bender says the four were members of the same family. Their names haven't been released, the AP reported on Saturday.
The Dayton Daily News , following up on the fatal crash, reported that accidents involving the horse-drawn buggies are not uncommon in the area. The paper said that the Ohio Department of Transportation did a study of buggy crashes in the state involving a motor vehicle from 2007 to 2016.
The study identified 1,412 crashes leading to 25 fatalities and 208 serious injuries during that period of time. The most common scenario was a motor vehicle not maintaining its distance on a straight state road.
The driver of the vehicle that struck the buggy on Friday fled on foot after the accident and was arrested a mile from the scene. Additional information about the accident and arrest was not available at press time.
