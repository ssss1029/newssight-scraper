High School Musical, the series that both revolutionized Disney Channel Original Movies and gave millions of children everywhere unrealistic expectations of high school theater, premiered 12 years ago.

Since the series ended with High School Musical 3: Senior Year in 2008, Zac Efron has gone on to star in movies ranging from Hairspray to Baywatch. Although he plays vastly different characters in each one, some HSM fans still stan him as Troy Bolton, varsity basketball star turned tortured artist.
Just look at how torn up he is!
Twitter user @Miexriir created a High School Musical timeline that tracks Zac Efron/Troy Bolton's career after his high school graduation.
After working on it for years, last night I think I finally cracked the secret to the High School Musical canon:
Its a split timeline pic.twitter.com/vVySWCD7JG
In the original trilogy, Troy Bolton graduates from high school. That's canon.
But then it splits off.
Troy either goes to college, doesn't go to college, or ends up in an interdimensional time vortex.
According to @Miexriir's timeline, if Troy ends up in going to college, he'll go on to star in Neighbors and We Are Your Friends, depending on if he's more of a weed guy or an ecstacy guy. Troy Bolton also ends sexism altogether in Neighbors 2.
But if Troy doesn't go to college, we get Baywatch and 17 Again, where he learns the secret of immortality and becomes a time traveling higher being.
Which would bring us to gems like The Greatest Showman, where Troy reconnects with his high school drama roots, and Hairspray, where Troy ends racism altogether by facilitating an integrated dance at the height of the civil rights movement.
What an icon.
But all of the timelines converge in The Lorax, which @Miexriir says is the point when society collapses, leaving Troy Bolton and Danny DeVito in an apocalyptic wasteland. And not to spoil the beloved Dr. Seuss story, but Troy Bolton is pretty much tasked with saving the environment.
High School Musical fans just couldn't believe how much Troy Bolton has done for humanity.
when Troy said "We're All In This Together".... he really fuckin meant it

Not all of Zac Efron's/Troy Bolton's roles were included in this timeline, for understandable reasons.
Dirty Grandpa is NOT a part of the HSM Extended Universe because there's no reality in which Troy Bolton would become a lawyer
