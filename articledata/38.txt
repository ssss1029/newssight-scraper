Buying Your First Real Watch? Here Are Five to Consider
All new, and all under $3,000

The two major watch shows of the yearSIHH and
Baselworld are now both firmly behind us, which means that we know most of the new watches that are going to be making their ways into boutique cases and onto wrists in 2018.We've told you about the watches we'd wear everyday , the watches that haunt our dreams , and even the things that caught us off-guard . We thought it would be worthwhile though to circle back, with this little bit of additional perspective, and to think about what watch we're recommend to someone looking to pick up his or her first fine timepiece. Luckily, this year we're spoiled for choice.
Tudor Black Bay 32

It's not often that I have the opportunity to suggest an actual ladies' watch for one of these round-ups, but I am thrilled to say that things are different this year. With the rise in dedicated tool watches in smaller sizes, I can honestly say that the Tudor Black Bay 32 is a great starter watch for the slight of wrist and can be yours for $2,750 on a bracelet and $2,425 on one of Tudor's awesome fabric straps. This watch is exactly the same as the Black Bay 36 released two years ago ( and last year's BB41 ) but in a smaller 32mm case size. It offers versatility, an automatic movement, and a price point that doesn't suffer from the pink tax.

Baume & Mercier Clifton Baumatic

In the 12 years or so that I've been writing about watches, the Clifton Baumatic might bethemost exciting timepiece to come from Baume & Mercier. Among the Baumatics many desirable features are its lengthy power reserve (120 hours), its antimagnetic movement (to 1,500 gauss), its chronometer rating (to within -4/+6 seconds per day), and its extended service cycle, which Baume & Mercier says is greater than five years. All of these are attributes that watch collectors have been conditioned to expect from watches costing much more than the Clifton Baumatic, which sits at $2,990. The movement at the heart of the Clifton Baumatic is the caliber BM12-1975A, a movement whose base was developed by Richemont at the group level for use in a range of the groups marques.
