I must admit that I didn't think much of Bojan Bogdanovic the first time I laid eyes on him; looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.
He had a quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around Indiana. He'd casually pull up for jumpers like a man who didn't have a care or worry in the world, as if he had on an invisible shield that would protect him from Playoff Lebron.
Yeah...I think it'd be fair to say that I liked Bojan from the start.
