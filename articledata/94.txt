FOR EXAMPLE: The classic episode where Rachel gets an apothecary table from Pottery Barn, but lies to Phoebe about getting it at a flea market. I've seen this episode approximately one billion times, but I somehow never realized what was REALLY going on until now...

Now listen. I know product placement happens on TV all the time, but it's rare for it to become so CENTRAL to the plot  which is probably why Entertainment Weekly ranked this episode #1 on their Best Product Placements roundup for the show.

And while we don't know how much $$$ Pottery Barn had to shell out for this episode, it sounds like it was a LOT. According to one Warner Bros. executive, Peter Roth, the deal was necessary to "offset the high cost of production."

In other words, the cast's million-dollar salaries didn't grow on trees, y'all!!!
Pottery Barn has also confirmed that they paid for the episode. One of their executives called it "the gift that keeps on giving" because "phones light up with catalogue requests every time it airs in syndication."
