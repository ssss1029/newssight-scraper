Welcome back to the IGN Movies Podcast! In this week's episode, Jim Vejvoda and Tom Jorgensen are joined by entertainment features executive editor Scott Collura to talk about the latest happenings in the genre moviesphere. (And sorry for such a long break in-between episodes!)
We dive into what we thought of the new Deadpool 2 and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom trailers, and also weigh in on the current state of video game movies in light of the recent release of Rampage.We also discuss the news that Steven Spielberg will direct a DC movie.
The bulk of this week's episode, though, is dedicated to which summer movies we're most looking forward to, starting with Marvel's The Avengers: Infinity War ... which we will be back next week to talk about in full spoilerish detail!
