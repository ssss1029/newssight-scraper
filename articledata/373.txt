Posting Rules
No screenshots or pictures of screens.  No pictures with added/superimposed digital elements. This includes image macros , comics, maps, infographics, MS Paint type scribbles, and most diagrams. Text (e.g. a URL) serving to credit the original author is exempt.  Blurring or boxing out of personal information (e.g. faces, license plates, phone numbers) is also exempt.
No porn or gore. NSFW content must be tagged.
No personal information. This includes anything hosted on Facebook's servers, as they can be traced to the original account holder. Stalking & harassment will not be tolerated. No missing-persons requests!
Titles must follow all title guidelines .
Submissions must link directly to a specific image file or to a website with minimal ads. We do not allow blog hosting of images ("blogspam"), but links to albums on image hosting websites are okay. URL shorteners are prohibited. URLs in image or album descriptions are prohibited.
No animated images. Please submit them to /r/gif , /r/gifs , or /r/reactiongifs instead.
We enforce a standard of common decency and civility here. Please be respectful to others. Personal attacks, bigotry, fighting words, otherwise inappropriate behavior or content, comments that insult or demean a specific user or group of users will be removed. Regular or egregious violations will result in a ban.
If your submission appears to be filtered, but definitely meets the above rules, please send us a message with a link to the comments section of your post (not a direct link to the image). Don't delete it as that just makes the filter hate you!
If you come across any rule violations please report the submission or message the mods and one of us will remove it!
Serial reposters may be filtered. False claims of ownership will result in a ban.
