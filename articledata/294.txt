Diamond is the hardest known naturally occurring material. Its nearly impossible to compress or scratch. But it can bend.
While diamonds are hard to scratch, theyre not so difficult to shatter  usually, trying to bend a diamond results in it fracturing. Now, Ming Dao at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his colleagues have made tiny diamond needles that can bend by up to 9 per cent without breaking, and then snap back
