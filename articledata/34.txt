The sale took place as the attention of collectors is starting to focus on the 2017 Bordeaux vintage being shown to merchants and the wider wine trade this month, prior to going on sale as en primeur futures for delivery in two years. The arrival of a new vintage on the market can divert attention from older wines, although the auction season follows a cycle of its own.
Bordeaux dominated the results, Stephen Mould, Sothebys head of wine for Europe, said in the statement. The price for the Lafleur 82 top lot, which beat its pre-sale estimate, reflected its impeccable provenance, he said.
Prices for leading Bordeaux wines are rebounding after falling 40 percent from a 2011 peak before leveling out. The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index is now up more than 30 percent from the floor it reached in 2015.
The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has been recovering over the past three years from its post-2011 slump.
