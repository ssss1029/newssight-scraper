On the promenade
Through an initial investigation into the stabbing, Ventura police learned that Jackson had been in the area of the promenade for several hours before the incident occurred.
At 6:23 p.m. on Wednesday, authorities were contacted about a man yelling and being disruptive near the Crowne Plaza Hotel, across the promenade from the Aloha Steakhouse.
All Ventura patrol officers in the area were assigned to other calls, so Ventura police used the pier security camera system to observe the man described by the witness, police said. The man was later determined by authorities to be Jackson.
After watching Jacksons behavior for more than 20 minutes, police determined Jackson did not appear to be causing a disturbance or threat to the public and canceled the call for service before any patrol resources could respond.
As part of the criminal investigation, Ventura police have released the surveillance footage in the hopes of contacting several people depicted speaking with Jackson. Anyone who made contact with Jackson is asked to call Sgt. Matt Cain at 805-339-4488.
