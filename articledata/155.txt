The star has battled Parkinsons disease since 1991. At first, he did so privately but went public with his diagnosis in 1998. Parkinsons is a disorder that causes uncontrollable tremors throughout his body.
Despite the challenges that come with such a diagnosis, Fox has continued pursuing his first love  acting. He recently joined the cast ofDesignated Survivor for the remainder of season2 alongside Kiefer Sutherland,Natascha McElhone, andMaggie Q.
Hes also appeared on The Good Wife from 2010 until 2016 and inCurb Your Enthusiasm.
In March 2017, Fox appeared on the cover ofAARP The Magazine and opened up about how he deals with his disease, revealing he laughs nonstop at himself, particularly when trying to deliver a cup of coffee to his wife of 30 years, Tracy Pollan.
The truth is that on most days, there comes a point where I literally cant stop laughing at my own symptoms, he said.
Just the other morning I come into the kitchen, he explained. I pour a cup  a little trouble there. Then I put both hands around the cup. Shes watching. Can I get that for you, dear? Nah, I got it!Then I begin this trek across the kitchen. It starts off bad. Only gets worse. Hot javas sloshing onto my hands, onto the floor.
He continued, But the thing that makes it hilarious to me is when I think of someone else watching all this and thinking, Poor Michael cant even get the coffee  its so sad!
Despite the challenges, he was reminded that he was not alone in his battle when legendary boxer Muhammad Al i, who suffered from Parkinsons disease for three decades, called him.
Fox remembered that moment with clarity, saying, In this raspy, paper-thin voice, he said, Aahhhhh  Michael, now that youre in it, well win this fight.
What could I say? added Fox. Sitting there alone listening to Muhammad Ali, this giant  I was welling up, almost openly weeping.
Fox told PEOPLE in 2006: Im so blessed with a great family, and Ive had success in my career. I feel this is a really unique opportunity for me to help out and try to effect change.
