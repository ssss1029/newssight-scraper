Blockchain eliminates the need for a third-party intermediary, such as a bank, by quickly creating a permanent, secure record of transactions.
Start-ups and major corporations alike are working to apply the technology to supply-chain management, financial services, property records and many other industries. Bitcoin is the first application of blockchain.
IBM , which also has a cloud computing service, is one of the leaders in enterprise blockchain development. The company reported $5.5 billion in revenue from cloud in the fourth quarter of last year.
For the same quarter, Amazon reported $5.1 billion in revenue from AWS. Jeff Bezos' company is set to report earnings Thursday, April 26.
