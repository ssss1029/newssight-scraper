Im here to quell your health concerns: staring at a screen doesnt damage your eyes. They wont make you go blind, and your doctor isnt going to worry about your health if he or she hears that youre spending a lot of time in front of them. However, you might feel uncomfortable after a long time in front of a backlight, and you might even experience the symptoms of Computer Vision Syndrome, a fancy name for the eye strain and discomfort monitors can cause.
You could try adjusting your entire monitor and desk setup to remedy your pain, or you could use moistening eyedrops. The 20-20-20 rule also exists, which dictates that after 20 minutes of screen staring, you should stare at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Take a break. Those blue light-filtering glasses you bought could help, too, but doctors arent totally convinced. Science just doesnt back up these glasses claims. That said, you could still wear them and hope for the best. They arent going to hurt you.
