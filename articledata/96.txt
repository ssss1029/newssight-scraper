This is one of those delightful series that peels back the curtain on the typical assumptions about peoples lives and reveals something more fun and marvelous. Dina Litovsky does a great job peeking in without satirizing or overdramatizing the situation.

The history of photography has not been a linear path, but rather a blossoming of creativity across a wide expanse of ideas and processes. Profiled here by Artsy, a new book titled The Short Story of Photography by Ian Haydn Smith chronicles some of the most profound artists that have shocked the world of photography and forever changed the way we view the world around us.

Theres really so much curiosity around North Korea that the general (internet) public will devour anything and everything that will give us a glimpse of their isolated society. Elijah Hurwitz contributes to this narrative in a significant way. The Chinese border is definitely not the more popular North Korean side, but its fascinating in its own way. Theres a stark contrast to the photos weve seen of the Korean DMZ. Here, youve got bridges and trade, and swimming is permitted in the river. In a lot of ways, what Hurwitz shows here could be just another border, and its telling of how, despite recent tensions with China, North Korea still has some friendly neighbors.
