Ill be helping build a larger meetup focused on pre- ICO companies in New York on April 23 and Id love to see you there. It will be held at Knotel on April 23 at 7pm and will feature a pitch-off with eight startups  I will write about the best ones  and two panels with some yet-unnamed stars in the space.
Id love to see you there, so please sign up here . The team is charging for tickets so we can get some beers and pizza for the attendees.
I am looking to fill out a panel so if youd like to join me on stage and have done extensive ICO work email me at john@ techcrunch .com.
