Germanys Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit yesterday from Axel Springer against Eyeo, the company behind AdBlock Plus .
The European publishing giant (which acquired Business Insider in 2015) argued that ad blocking, as well as the business model where advertisers pay to be added to circumvent the white list, violated Germanys competition law. Axel Springer won a partial victory in 2016, when a lower court ruled that it shouldnt have to pay for white listing.
However, the Supreme Court has now overturned that decision. In the process, it declared that ad-blocking and Eyeos white list are both legal. (German speakers can read the courts press release .)
After the ruling, Eyeo sent me the following statement from Ben Williams, its head of operations and communications:
Today, we are extremely pleased with the ruling from Germanys Supreme Court in favor of Adblock Plus/eyeo and against the German media publishing company Axel Springer. This ruling confirms  just as the regional courts in Munich and Hamburg stated previously  that people have the right in Germany to block ads. This case had already been tried in the Cologne Regional Court, then in the Regional Court of Appeals, also in Cologne  with similar results. It also confirms that Adblock Plus can use a whitelist to allow certain acceptable ads through. Todays Supreme Court decision puts an end to Axel Springers claim that they be treated differently for the whitelisting portion of Adblock Plus business model.
