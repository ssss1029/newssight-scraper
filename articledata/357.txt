Wizards of the Coast
Dungeons & Dragons is in the middle of a major renaissance, thanks in part to dedicated groups performing the role-playing game online . As fans of Critical Role or The Adventure Zone will tell you, podcasts are vehicles for some of the very best D&D stories of our time . Thats why developer and publisher Wizards of the Coast is inviting nearly two-dozen live play podcasts to sample its newest sourcebook, and you can listen in all throughout the month of May .
Wizards gave 21 live play podcasts and two Twitch channels access to its next book, called Mordenkainens Tome of Foes, and asked them to use them it in their next adventure. The result should be a month-long cavalcade of outstanding audio drama, with two podcasts per week and Twitch streams on the weekend.
Tome of Foes goes on sale at local game stores May 18th and lands at other major retailers later in the month. Like Xanathars Guide To Everything and Volos Guide to Monsters , you can expect it to contain a bit more flavor  in the form of a quirky narrator  than your average splatbook. But it will also be packed to the gills with deadly new monsters, including new demons and devils, several varieties of elves and duergar, and a vast array of other creatures from throughout the planes of existence.
