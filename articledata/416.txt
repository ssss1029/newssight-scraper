She was conscious and was able to walk off the ice with some assistance.She was later seen being escorted to an ambulance and taken to a hospital for evaluation, according to online reports.
According to an NBC reporter, citing a USA Luge source, the hospital evaluation is likely part of concussion protocol.
Though this is Sweeneys first Olympic appearance, she is no stranger to the competition. She narrowly missed a spot at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Her older sister, Megan, ultimately nabbed that spot, NBC reported.
