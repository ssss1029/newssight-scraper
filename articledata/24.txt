Draft Express lists Doncic as 6'8" and 228 pounds, making him a swingman capable of playing shooting guard and small forward.
He has accumulated an impressive list of accolades during his young career, including the ACB Best Young Player Award and Euroleague Rising Star Trophy for 2016-17.
Additionally, Doncic helped lead Slovenia to a gold medal in the 2017 EuroBasket tournament.
Doncic will be part of a stacked draft class that includes former collegiate stars such as Arizona's Deandre Ayton, Duke's Marvin Bagley III and Oklahoma's Trae Young.
In his latest big board rankings, Bleacher Report's Jonathan Wasserman rated Doncic as the No. 2 player in the draft behind Ayton.
Wasserman projected in his most recent mock draft that the Memphis Grizzlies will select Doncic with the second overall pick.
