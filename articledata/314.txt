Blakely said that Cohen could be indicted within 90 days, pointing to a previous statement from Danielss lawyer, Michael Avenatti, to that effect, CNN reported .

Always a bad sign when the judge tells you that your motion has gaping holes in it, as the judge told the attys for MC and DJT this AM. I dont know why they continue to hide what they know about the FBI raids. Time to come clean and let the chips fall where they may. #basta

Five days earlier, Avenatti told CNN, I strongly believe that within the next 90 days were going to see the unsealing of an indictment against Mr. Cohen for a host of very serious offenses.
Avenatti, who has repeatedly taken the opportunity to slam Cohen and Trump, said he believes Cohen will decide to flip by this summer or earlierand cooperate with federal prosecutors.
There is zero question in my mind that Michael Cohen is going to be indicted for some very serious, pervasive conduct, Avenatti told Vanity Fair in a report published Thursday.

Avenatti claims to have evidence that Cohen engaged in bank fraud andit will prove that Trump was aware that Cohen paid Daniels and other women hush money to cover up alleged affairs.
Theres a significant level of cooperation between us and the Southern District of New York U.S. attorneys office, he added.
Trump is reportedly worried about thecharges that Cohen could potentially be hit withand whether his lawyer will flip.
