Had Chelsea faced City on Saturday (April 14) rather than last month, Antonio Conte may have approached the game with a greater belief, rather than the pedestrian approach they did take in the 1-0 defeat. But circumstances have changed since then and Chelsea had their chance.
Now, it is the turn of Tottenham to take on City, to force them to keep the party poppers packaged up and the champagne chilled. United have already begun their pursuit of City in the race for next seasons championship, and now it is Mauricio Pochettinos turn.
They will certainly go into the game full of confidence having not lost a Premier League game in 2018; the only problem is that the last defeat came against City at the Etihad.
They have all but cemented their place in next seasons Champions League by extending the gap with fifth-place Chelsea to 10 points with six games to go. And there is still a flicker of life in this season yet for Spurs.
With a game in hand over Liverpool, Spurs can leapfrog a Jurgen Klopp team that could be preoccupied with Europe. Catching United is alsonot beyond the realms of possibility, with Mourinhos team only four points ahead.
Spurs can inflict a psychological blow to United when they meet in the FA Cup semifinal on April 21. But first they must keep up the chase. They must do what is now believed to be possible. They must make City wait another week.
