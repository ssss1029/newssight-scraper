The teen who marched alone last month, attracting the attention of the country, just got his classmates to join a student walkout in memory of the 15 victims of the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School.
Justin Blackman received massive support on social media last month for being the only student at his high school to participate in the nationwide walkout, part of movement led by Parkland survivors that called for lawmakers to pass stricter gun laws.
