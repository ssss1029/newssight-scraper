On Fridays broadcast of HBOs Real Time, host Bill Maher expressed concern that the Stormy Daniels story is taking a lot of energy away from real issues.
While interviewing Daniels attorney,Michael Avenatti, Maher stated that he worries that despite all the giddiness on the left, Trump will simply pardon everyone or not show up for a deposition. He added,But, my other worry about it is that its taking a lot of energy away from real issues.
Avenatti countered, I think the cover-up and lying to the American people is always a real issue.
Maher responded, Yes, but its actually not what polls say people care about. They care about health care, which doesnt get a lot of coverage. They care about the tax cut, which doesnt get a lot of coverage. Because theyre all chasing stories like this. Im not saying you should stop doing what youre doing.  I think its great what you are doing.
