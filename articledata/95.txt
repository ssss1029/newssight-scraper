Promising review: "My skin is the best it has ever been. Seriously. This moisturizer has an interesting texture because it is lighter than most moisturizers I have used. I know this sounds weird, but it feels like I am putting water on my face. I don't know how this works, but it must be sorcery, because it absorbs really quickly and lasts for a long time. The texture is basically magic, and I mean that in the best way possible."  dmarsh1
