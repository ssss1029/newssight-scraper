Alienware recently partnered with Hilton Panama to create an entire battlestation that doubles as a hotel room  a.k.a. the PC gamers wet dream.
Juan Carlos Garcs, General Director of Intel in Colombia, to HomeCrux :
With this unique offer in the market, once again the Hilton Panama Hotel is consolidated as a hotel that focuses its tourism offer on providing unique and memorable experiences to its customers, guests and visitors.
What it is: Alienwares room in the Hilton Panama contains a full complement of equipment for the discerning gamer, including two PCs, a virtual reality set-up and an interactive lighting system.
The details:As a gamer guest of the Hilton Panama, youll have at your disposal a powerful desktop, a 65-inch OLED TV, 5.1-channel stereo sound system, a racing chair, and two Xbox Elite controllers. If thats not enough to keep you occupied for at least an epoch, youll also have a laptop, an Oculus Rift , and two king-sized beds decked out in the Alienware logo.

Why it matters:PC battlestations are extremely expensive, not to mention difficult to maintain. If you cant afford to buy one yourself, then this room gives you a little glimpse into what its like to live the dream of teenage me (and also current me).
The room costs roughly $359 dollars a night  which sounds fairly expensive until you price out the actual hardware. A comparable Alienware desktop alone would set you back at least $2,000, so a few nights with it is bargain by comparison.
