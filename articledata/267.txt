You can start with easy steps like ditching your straw .
Plant a Tree
Trees play an important role in balancing our ecosystem by absorbing carbon. They can even help reduce the impacts of climate change by pulling greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.
The organization One Tree Planted organizes meet-ups for people to plant trees together, but if you don't see your region represented, you can easily sign up to stage your own event. Earth Day Network also organizes tree-planting groups in urban areas and schools or allows you to donate.
Go Local
Local communities are at the front lines of keeping their towns green. Online platforms like Eventbrite and Facebook can help you find Earth Day events in your own town. Many cities hold gatherings like festivals, marches, talks, or concerts to help stoke that Earth Day fervor.
And, of course, you can always let your representatives in Congress know where your priorities are by writing to them .
Celebrate Through Song
How do you write a classical music score for the Earth? These composers tackled the challenge for National Geographic's Symphony for Our World event.
Symphony for Our World pairs stunning natural images with a symphonic composition by Bleeding Fingers Music. On Earth Day, the Nat Geo WILD channel will air an hour-long special at 7p.m. EST/6p.m. CST. Images will come from National Geographic and Joel Sartore's Photo Ark , a project to photographically document key animal species.
After April 22 the symphony will then go on tour in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and Mexico. A full schedule and tickets can be found here .
