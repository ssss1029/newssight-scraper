New York City has an incredible density of up-and-coming enterprise-focused startups. While the winners are publicized and well-known, we felt it was time to put a bit of a spotlight on younger companies, ones you may not have heard about yet, but are likely to in the coming years.
TechCrunch asked two dozen founders, venture capitalists, and other community members which companies  other than ones they are directly connected to  they thought were most likely to change the enterprise world in the coming years. From a list of 64 nominated startups, we chose twelve we thought best exemplified the potential for New York. All data on venture capital fundraised comes from Crunchbase. Also be sure to check out our in-depth profiles of NS1 , Datadog , BigID , Packet , and Timescale as well as Security Scorecard, Uplevel, and HYPR , which were not included on this list.
