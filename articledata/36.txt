Canadian Pacific Unions Call Strike Inevitable Hours After Deal Lauded
By
Labor groups strongly recommend workers reject offer
Late Friday agreement for vote avoided a midnight walkout
After agreeing at the last minute to stave off a strike, unions at
Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. are urging their members to reject the companys offer and say its only a matter of time before they walk off the job.
CP succeeded in delaying the inevitable," Doug Finnson, president of the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference, which represents about 3,000 train conductors and engineers, said in a
statement on Saturday. "The government will bring this ridiculous offer to our members and we strongly recommend that members vote against it.
Teamsters Canada and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about about 360 signal maintainers, agreed late Friday to a recommendation from federal mediators that the Canadian Industrial Relations Board administer a ratification vote. While that averted a potential walkout starting at midnight, it didnt portend labor peace, with both unions saying Saturday they strongly recommend members reject the company offers.
The groups wont release details of the offers until workers have a chance to review it, but say they dont satisfy workers concerns around fatigue and wages. More than 8,000
grievances have been filed against CP by Teamster members, and close to 300 by IBEW members, in the last three years. Earlier this month, members of the Teamsters and IBEW voted 94 percent and 98 percent in favor of a strike, the unions said.
Tremendous News
Late Friday, CPs Chief Executive Officer Keith Creel hailed the fact that a strike had been avoided. This is tremendous news for our employees, our customers and the Canadian economy, he said in a
statement .
The company didnt immediately respond Saturday to a request outside of normal business hours for a comment on the union statement.
Canadas labor minister said it would ask the Canadian Industrial Relations Board to administer a ratification vote on each of the companys final offers to the two unions.
Our Government believes in the collective bargaining process, Labor Minister Patty Hajdu said in a statement. I met with the parties in Calgary and encouraged them to continue their hard work to reach a fair deal that avoids any disruption in service.
Bad Deal
Canadian Pacific said it will immediately execute a safe and structured startup of its operations that will avoid any rail disruption.
Creel said on April 18 that Canadian Pacific had contingency plans it would execute in the event of a walkout. He also vowed not to sacrifice long-term profitability just to get a bad deal in place.
The electronic vote of the unions, which will be conducted by the Canada Industrial Relations Boards, has yet to be scheduled.
The fact that CP thinks their offer has a chance in hell of being ratified shows how out of touch they are with their employees, Steve Martin, senior general chairman from IBEW System Council No. 11, said in the statement. The company is in for a wake-up call.
