Ever fielded a text or email so chock full of typos and grammar errors that it felt less like reading and more like code breaking? The sad fact is that the advent of quick, on-the-fly digital communication has done its fair share of damage to the English language.
Unfortunately, if you suffer from a lack of attention to detail with spelling, punctuation and basic sentence structure, it can come back to haunt you. You can make sure every word of prose you produce is picture perfect with a lifetime subscription to Ginger Page , now only $69.99 (90 percent off) from TNW Deals.
Ginger will make sure that no matter where youre writing  on a phone, on the web, or via any device  your content is error-free and avoids all the writing no-nos that can even afflict the strongest of writers.
With the app downloaded to your operating system, Ginger Page serves as your friendly instructor, looking over your shoulder at everything you write and spotting mistakes like misspellings, incorrect punctuation, and more.
But where Ginger Page truly excels (its scored rave reviews from Venture Beat, Lifehacker, and several other sites) is when it goes beyond simple writing errors. Ginger Page actually examines your sentence structure, spotting flaws, then offering recommendations to make your writing really jump off the screen.
Ginger Page will help you change up your word choices, translate text into 50 different languages, and present practice sessions personalized to your weaknesses to build you up as a writer.
Ginger Page works with virtually any operating system, so youve got no excuse not to take advantage of this limited time $69.99 deal for lifetime access. Or if youd like to test it out first, you can try shorter 3-year ($49.99) and 1-year ($29.99) service plans instead.
