The @Bucks just announced that @AaronRodgers12 has bought in and is now a part owner of the franchise. The @Packers QB is here sitting courtside along with girlfriend Danica Patrick and fellow Bucks owner Wes Edens.
Rodgers joins a Milwaukee ownership group that includes the three primary owners:Wes Edens, Marc Lasry and Jamie Dinan.
Since the Bucks' current owners took over prior to the 2014-15 season, they have made three postseason appearances.
Rodgers and Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo are two of the biggest stars in their respective sports. The two-time NFL MVP has spent his entire career with the Packers, leading the franchise to a victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLV after the 2010 season.
