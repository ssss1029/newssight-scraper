Epic Games
Theres no better feeling in Fortnite than capturing the moment you execute a spectacular move with a grenade launcher or cinch a victory after hours of playing.
Thats why players have been upset with faulty replay captures. Epic Games first announced an in-game replay tool was coming to Fortnite at the end of March , but didnt unleash it until update patch v3.5 just a couple of weeks ago . The replay tool was developed as a way to give YouTubers better in-game, cinematic camera features, and allow other players to revisit their previous matches to better understand their gameplay techniques.
It only took a short while for players to notice that replay saves were showing as corrupt files, which Epic Games addressed in a recent Reddit post.
As of now any replays that were saved in a previous update will not work once a new one is released, a representative wrote on Reddit . However, in the future, we are working towards making replays work for the entirety of each major patch. This means that your replays would work until we have another major patch, which is usually every two weeks.
For example, a replay saved in v3.5 will not be watchable in v3.5.1 is the current situation Fortnite players are in, according to Epic. The studio is hoping to make it so that a replay saved in v3.5 will work in every v3.5 version (v3.5.1, v3.5.2, etc), adding that even those replays, however, will still be unwatchable once v3.6 releases.
It isnt too unusual for saved files to stop working when an update rolls out, and Epic Games is telling players to keep this in mind when planning your editing sessions. Fortunately, Fortnite players have discovered new ways of saving their replay sessions. PlayStation players are using the consoles share button on the controller to capture gameplay. Although the footage may not be as cinematic as Epics in-game tool, it appears to get the job done for the time being.
Cant you just hit the share button on the controller to record the screen while you watch the replay, one person said on Reddit . If you cant save replays, that would be the next best option.
It may be the best solution for now until Epic works out a better option.
