Hailed as the legendary godmother of comedy and den mother to four decades of stand-up comedians, Mitzi Shore, owner of the famed Comedy Store in Los Angeles, died early Wednesday. She was 87.
Shores death, which followed a long battle with Parkinsons disease, was confirmed by the clubs spokesperson Jodi Gottlieb. In a statement cited by the Associated Press, Gottleib described Shore as an extraordinary businesswoman who cultivated and celebrated the artistry of stand-up comedy.
Mitzis son, comedian and actor Pauly Shore, described her as a giver, who gave her heart, her soul, and her stages, to generations of aspiring comedians.

Born in 1930 in Marinette, Wis., Shore assumed ownership of a new comedy club on Hollywoods Sunset Strip following her divorce from comedian Sammy Shore in 1974. The Comedy Store became an institution under her stewardship, offering a kind of college of comedy , as TIME wrote in 2008, where comedians could meet and workshop untested material.
When Mitzi took over, she changed the pace , comedian Tom Dreesen told The Hollywood Reporter. She gave comedians tight 20-minute sets, which meant the audience could see a half-dozen acts in one show. The Strip was an exciting place back then. Stand-up comedy became the rock n rock of the 70s.
The clubs stage was paced by many of the biggest names in American comedy, from future late night hosts Jay Leno and David Letterman to Richard Pryor, Robin Williams, Jerry Seinfeld and Roseanne Barr. Jim Carrey was given his first opportunity there as a doorman, a frequent entry point for inexperienced comedians who hungered for a few minutes with the microphone.
The great Mitzi Shore, owner of the famous Comedy Store, has passed away. No words can express the gratitude I have for her. We met in 1979. She opened the door to my dreams! If she loved you, you did well. If she didnt, you did something else. I will love her forever. ;^) pic.twitter.com/lBNXnW0mEr

Shores refusal to pay comedians, who she said benefited from the clubs artists colony atmosphere, alienated some of her most reliable performers and closest friends. But she was also lauded for promoting female comedians like Sandra Bernhard, Diane Nichols and Whoopi Goldberg, at a time when sexism was pervasive in the industry.
Tributes to Shore poured in on social media, with many performers celebrating the mentor who gave them their first start in show business.
Mitzi Shore was a pioneer who gave more comics their start than I can countI did my first legit comedy gig at the Store. She was a woman in a male dominated business who pulled no punches, something I always admired. My heart goes out to @paulyshore and the entire Shore family pic.twitter.com/kabGgWMVuR

#MitziShore created something very special for comics and a very special space for women. She was ahead of her time, a true outlier. Her legacy has had a direct impact on the comic I have become and, for that, I am forever grateful.  Im sorry @PaulyShore
