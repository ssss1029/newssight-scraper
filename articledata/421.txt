The parents of a Republican Senate hopeful in Wisconsin have maxed out donations to the primary campaign of the Democrat he hopes to unseat.
Just months after Republican Kevin Nicholson announced his bid to run against incumbent Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) in 2018, Nicholsons own parents donated the legal maximum to Baldwins primary campaign, CNN reports.
Nicholsons parents, Donna and Michael, reportedly donated $2,700 to Baldwin in December 2017. Nicholson had announced in July that he was seeking the Republican nomination for the Senate seat.

Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) speaks on April 25, 2017.
My parents have a different worldview than I do,Nicholson, a former Democrat , told CNN by way of explanation.
It is not surprising that they would support a candidate like Tammy Baldwin who shares their perspective.
Democrats have been increasingly nervous about Baldwins seat , with the incumbent targeted by an onslaught of outside spending from conservative groups.

Democratic Party leaders have said the odds remain in Baldwins favor, but theyre not going to take the race for granted.
By early January, nine groups had spent more than $4.7 million on ads that attack Baldwin or boost one of the Republicans vying to oppose her, according to her campaign.
