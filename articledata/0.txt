The Environmental Protection Agency has released new details about Administrator Scott Pruitt 's schedule in Morocco last year that show he was scheduled for only one meeting on the first day of the costly trip.
The new details about Pruitts schedule came in an updated response to a records request from ABC News and other news organizations on the Morocco trip, which generated controversy both about his spending habits and his justification for being there. Earlier this month, the EPA released the six-page schedule from Pruitt's 47-hour North Africa trip with four pages blacked out .
On Friday, the EPA made public an unredacted version of the schedule after criticism from government watchdog groups about the agencys lack of transparency.
The newly released version of the calendar showed the four previously blacked-out pages of his calendar did not include any additional meetings beyond those already released.
The four-page redaction to the Morocco schedule is simply a calendar entry for a Senior Staff Meeting at EPA Headquarters in D.C., which the Administrator did not attend because he was in Morocco," EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox said in a statement Friday. The entry includes all attendees invited to the meeting, which is the reason for the extensive redaction.
Wilcox said Saturday that Pruitt originally had more meetings scheduled that first day in Morocco but his plans changed after weather delayed his flight out of Dulles International Airport on Dec. 9. He did not immediately respond to a request for details about those meetings.
Due to snow in Washington, Administrator Pruitts outbound flight was delayed, he missed his connection in Paris, spent the night there and flew out the next morning," Wilcox said in a statement.

The document release, however, did not address questions from Democratic lawmakers about the number and nature of Pruitts meetings.
"For a trip  that included at least 10 EPA staff, your official business consisted of one full working day, and two days each with one, one-hour meeting," Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse , D-R.I., a top Democratic on the committee with oversight of EPA, wrote in recent letter to Pruitt.
Adam Marshall, an attorney with the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press , told ABC News on Friday the EPA should not have blacked out the staff meeting in its initial response. The agencys explanation for the redaction  citing it as part of its deliberative process privilege  was improper.
"There have certainly been lots of questions raised as to how the EPA is handling FOIA requests under the current administration and I think that this adds to that growing list of questions as to what is going on when it comes to EPA and FOIA," he told ABC News.
