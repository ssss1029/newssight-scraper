No one expected this. In the longest-running experiment of its kind, the plants that were supposed to thrive in higher carbon dioxide levels have instead done less well.
The finding suggests plants will not take up as much CO2 in the future as climate models assume  potentially leading to greater warming in the long term.
To get this result is startling, says Peter Reich of the University of Minnesota in St Paul. His team has run a 20-year experiment looking at how
