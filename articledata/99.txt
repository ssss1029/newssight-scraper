Right-Wing YouTubers Think Its Only A Matter Of Time Before They Get Kicked Off The Site
YouTube's crackdown on hate speech and other "unsafe" content is causing many of the biggest stars of the far right to look for alternatives.

David Seaman, a conspiracy theorist banned from YouTube, seen in a video on BitChute.
In late February, David Seaman published an angry video rant in which he complained about getting banned by YouTube for pushing conspiracies about the Parkland high school shooting.
This is obscene, being censored in my own country, Seaman said. Who am I? I'm the journalist who helped break Pizzagate.
Seaman certainly played a major part in popularizing the bizarre right-wing conspiracy theory that prominent Democratic politicians ran a child exploitation ring out of the basement of a Washington, DC, pizza shop. Before he was kicked off YouTube, he had more than 160,000 subscribers and his videos had been watched more than 11 million times, according to Social Blade, a social media tracking service.
Seamans daily dispatches about the secret forces running the world now live on BitChute , one of several services vying to become the preferred right-wing alternative to Googles video streaming behemoth.
For years YouTube has been home to a large and influential network of people creating conspiratorial and far-right political videos. But a mixture of brand safety concerns from advertisers, criticism about the way its recommendation algorithms can push users to conspiratorial videos, and growing concerns about hate speech and misinformation led YouTube to exercise stronger moderation and hand out strikes to publishers that violate its policies. After three strikes, theyre banned from the platform, as was the case with Infowars Washington correspondent Jerome Corsi . He now regularly livestreams from Gab, the messaging platform best known for hosting trolls and neo-Nazis banned from Twitter. It recently rolled out a video platform.
The result of the YouTube crackdown is that prominent right-wing YouTubers are scrambling to find alternatives, setting up shop on YouTube wannabes, or even building their own video apps. Its all in preparation for what they see as the inevitable day when YouTube gives them the boot or forbids them from making money on the platform by demonetizing all of their videos. (A similar dynamic is also underway with YouTubers who produce content about guns; BuzzFeed News recently reported that theyre creating their own firearm-friendly video platforms .)
