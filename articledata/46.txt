The details: The investigation reportedly concerns tech that lets customers switch wireless providers without switching SIM cards. The carriers, the Times story says , are accused of influencing the standard-setting process for that technology in order to give them a way to keep a phone from leaving their networks.
"The accusationsregarding this issue are much ado about nothing," said Rich Young, a Verizon spokesman. "We've been proactively and constructively working with the Department of Justice for several months regarding this inquiry and we continue to do so."
"Along with other GSMA members, we have provided information to the government in response to their requests and will continue to work proactively within GSMA, including with those who might disagree with the proposed standards, to move this issue forward," said an AT&T spokesman.
The industry group in question, GSMA, declined to comment. The Justice Department said it "does not confirm, deny, or otherwise comment, on the existence or nonexistence of investigations."
