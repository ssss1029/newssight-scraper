Actress Amy Schumer responded to criticism of her latest filmI Feel Prettyby suggesting her role should have been given to a woman of color.
In an appearance onThe Viewon Friday,Schumer said that the films poor reviews, many of which suggested her character was too privileged to garner sympathy, had only made her excited for people to see the movie.
Its not about an ugly, vile troll getting beautiful, Schumer said. Its about a girl who really struggles with self-esteem, which is something we can all relate to.
The film follows the life ofRenee Barrett, an overweight woman who struggles with low self-esteem and one day falls off her exercise bike and wakes up believing she has supermodel looks.
Also, I think it is fair to say that its a lot harder for other people, Schumer continued, I recognize that I am a caucasian, like  I would love if this movie were starring a woman of color whos had it way harder than me, and I think, I hope we get there. This is hopefully just a step in the right direction.
I Feel Prettyhas also received criticism by feminist groups who accuse it of body shaming and enforcing unrealistic beauty standards.
Yet Schumer, 36, remains a prominent left-wing political activist and is known for championing feminist causes such as the body positivity movement.
In an interview this week withTime,Schumer revealed that the election of Donald Trump has been a nightmare for her, adding that she has been doing less stand up comedy because it is no longer funny.
