Best: Jessica and Alisa Jones,Jessica Jones
As everyJessica Jones viewer knows, the heroine gained her powers when her entire family died long ago in an accident. But in a shocking season 2 episode, she discovers (spoiler alert!)that the villain Jessica (Krysten Ritter) has been chasing is, in fact, her own mother, Alisa (Janet McTeer), who did not, in fact, die in that accident but did, in fact, become super strong and super evil.

Best: Maya Lewis and Olivia Pope,Scandal
The saga of Olivias (Kerry Washington) mother had many parts. For the first few seasons,Scandal audiences (and Liv herself) were led to believe that Maya (Khandi Alexander) died on a plane, along with 300-plus other people, in a terrorist attack. Then Shonda Rhimes and her co-conspirators hit us with the fact that the plane didnt explode but was rather shot down by a Navy plane flown byFitzgerald Grant. Then it was revealed that Maya was never even on the plane in the first place; she was removed by her husband (and Olivias father) and then lied about the bomb. Oh, and Olivia assumed she was dead because her father told her so, all the while keeping her locked up in a hole for decades.

Worst: Rachel and Shelby onGlee
Rachel (Lea Michele) was the last person on the planet to find out that vocal coach Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel) was actually her mom. The final reveal happened during (what else?) a musical performance where Rachel heard Shelby singingFunny Girl and recognized her voice. It was superGlee, but not exactly groundbreaking.

Best: Peter Pan and Rumplestiltskin,Once Upon a Time
It can be nearly impossible to keep track of all the plot twists and turns onOnce Upon a Time, not to mention keeping the characters straight. But even the most confused viewer felt the shockwaves when Pan was revealed as Rumples father. The story goes like this: When Rumple (Robert Carlyle) was a wee lad, he and his dad escaped to Neverland, but his dad was soon convinced to leave because his heart wasnt young enough. He wound up assuming the name of Peter Pan, all unbeknownst to current-day Henry. (Did you get all that?)

Best: Kimmy and Lori-Ann Schmidt,Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt
The entire second season of the Netflix comedy built towards Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) finally finding her long-lost mother. The identity of her mom wasnt so much groundbreaking as was the identity of the actress who plays her mom. The Lisa Kudrow reveal was a terrific casting coup and their reunion (at Universal Studios, no less) was the perfect combination of sad and hilarious.

Worst: Baby Blair Waldorf,Gossip Girl
Chuck Bass: You arenotthe father. It was the question that no one was asking, mostly because we were all so exhausted from the ups and downs of the lives of the Upper East Siders. Regardless, as everyone expected, Blair (Leighton Meester) took a paternity test and it turned out the baby belonged to Louis Grimaldi (Hugo Becker).

Petrelli, founder of The Company and father to Peter (Milo Ventimiglia) and Nathan (Adrian Pasdar), was long assumed to be dead  until season 3, that is. Arthur (Robert Forster) was revealed to be very much alive, albeit confined to a respirator, and continuing with his evil ways.

Worst: Perry Wright and Ziggy Chapman,Big Little Lies
Okay, stay with us for a moment. Were not actually criticizing the most perfect Monterey miniseries. Were merely stating that in the cadre of big parent reveals, this one fell near the bottom. To start,BLL was a book so a lot of people werent actually surprised when it played out on the small screen. Those who were surprised about Perry (Alexander Skarsgrd) being Jane Chapmans rapist  and, subsequently, Ziggys (Iain Armitage) father  had secretly kind of guessed it all along. And, finally, theare you my daddy portion of the plot twist was swiftly overshadowed by the revelation that Perry was the rapist Jane had been hunting and, well, his death.

Best: Maggie, Richard, and Ellis,Grey's Anatomy
Dang it if Shonda Rhimes doesnt know how to introduce a new character. Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary) replaced Yang as the head of the department in the penultimate episode of season 10 and by the season finale, it was revealed that her biological mother was Ellis Grey (Kate Burton), making her both Richards (James Pickens Jr.) daughterandMerediths half-sister. Phew.

Worst: Sam Sylvia and Justine Biagi,Glow
The ick factor is high here. Justine (Britt Baron) is the star of the show-within-a-show onGlow and Sam (Marc Maron) is the smarmy director. After several episodes in which it became increasingly clear that Justine had her sites set on the older man, Sam tried to hook up with her. The skeeviness was amplified tenfold when she exclaimed that she was his daughter.

All was revealed as the Doctor and Rory attempted to rescue Amy from kidnappers who casually wanted to use her baby in their war against Doctor Who  the baby wound up getting stolen, but then River showed up to out herself as thebaby and revealed that her real name is Melody Pond.

Worst: Diana Payne and Chuck Bass,Gossip Girl
In season 10, the ascot-wearing Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) who everyone loves to hate found out  via a blast from Gossip Girl, naturally  that the older woman sleeping with Nate was actually his birth mother, Diana (Elizabeth Hurley). She had an affair with Bart Bass, but gave up the baby to Elizabeth Bass. In other words, it all tracked.
