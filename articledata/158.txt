Scandal signed off Thursday with one last heartbreak  one that was nearly spoiled by the actor at the center of the series finales most shocking tragedy.
During the final episode of ABCs political fixer drama, Cyrus (Jeff Perry) poisoned David Rosen (Joshua Malina), making him the shows final official casualty.*
But with Malina out on tour with his podcast, The West Wing Weekly, he found it increasingly difficult not to let slip the major tragedy that would befall his character in advance. Everywhere weve gone, people are constantly asking me, trying to get me to stay stuff, Malina tells EW. Ive almost, a couple times, erred not by revealing that he died, but being too [over the top]. People would be like, Well, maybe a spin-off, and Id be like, Yeah, oh yeah, maybe hell be in the spin-off for sure. I went too far the other way. I had to just shut up.
Even on Friday afternoon, long after the series finale had aired, the actor found himself temporarily nervous he had said too much. I had seven years of dont say anything every time I would do an interview or had a fan interaction, Malina says. Now that the show is over and Im talking to you, I still find myself guarding it, but theres no more secrets to be kept and its kind of a relief.

Still, Malina is quite surprised that the news of David Rosens demise didnt end up leaking ahead of Thursdays series finale. I remember when Shonda [Rhimes] told me it was going to happen, it had to be kept top secret, Malina says. But I told a couple people in my family, and then at the table read obviously everybody else found out, and then we shot the episode and everybody else involved in Scandal [found out]. It seemed to me that it was just going to get out somehow because these things always just do. So I was delighted that we still went into finale night with the element of surprise, and Im enjoying seeing how surprised and shocked people seem to be on Twitter.
The response to David Rosens death on Twitter has been overwhelming, Malina says. I feel a little bit like Sally Field  they liked him, they really liked him!  because people seem to be ultimately sad or mad. Mainly Im finding that people are shocked and surprised. However, some fans have also ribbed Malina for Rosens fatal mistake. Im getting a lot of, Why did you take the drink?' he says. Im getting a fair amount of grief for it. David is a fairly trusting person, even though he may be sitting with a murderous criminal whose confession hes taking, hes going to check the drink? Some people are not happy with him.
Reactions from his family have been quite different altogether. Im getting a lot of condolences from family, a lot of references to sitting Shiva, he says with a laugh. A lot of my Jewish relatives are apparently sitting Shiva for my character.
As for Rosens swan song, it was certainly not what Malina had in mind for his character, though even he has a hard time imagining a different ending for the white-hat wearing attorney general. I havent given it too much thought, because I largely got out of the whats going to happen next? game with Scandal, because I was always wrong, he says. The only thing that really occurred to me was maybe he was going to get his romantic happy ending with Abby [Darby Stanchfield]. I thought they could end up on a good note together, but it was not to be.
The one thing he does wish wouldve happened is Cyrus actually paying for his crimes during the finale. In the version that went to air, Cyrus is simply forced to resign, but in an extended version of the script that was revealed at the live table read Thursday night, Cyrus was ultimately visited by Huck (Guillermo Diaz), implying he was going to be tortured, if not also killed. *(Oh yeah, remember that asterisk? Yup, this would technically be the unofficial last casualty, though thats left unanswered.) I absolutely wouldve liked the little red toolbox to figure into Cyrus future, Malina says. I was sorry to see him get off, but maybe that also is the way that things roll in the Scandal universe.

Davids death was all the more shocking as Malina confirms initially hearing the same rumor as Katie Lowes that no one would die in the finale. Hence, his guard was completely down upon learning the news. I had been worrying for seven seasons about whether I was going to be killed off, Malina says. When it finally happened, I was like, What? Really? I was surprised.
In that vein, Malina feels like the way in which David dies is very similar to the prank Jimmy Kimmel helped play on him prior to the finale. I was very concerned about some sort of revenge being taken on me by the cast, to the point where the last few days of shooting, I didnt even park in my parking spot, he says. I dont even want them to know where my car is. I would park far away and then walk onto the lot. Then, we did the GMA thing  well, not really  weeks after we wrapped, and thats when my guard was down. Thats when they get you, as soon as your guard is down.
Though Malina will no longer be working alongside the Scandal cast, he does vow to someday get vengeance for that last prank. They got me bad, for sure, he says. I havent learned my lesson. Now I have to go deep into planning for how to get them back. In a prank war, you have to top the last prank, so thats a very tall order given what they did to me and the resources that they had. I think I have to go into some fiendish planning and wait a long time for their guards to drop, and maybe I have to crowdfund some money to put on whatever I come up with.
While he didnt learn that lesson, the one he did learn while filming his death scene will stick with him: Never go down without a fight. Ive only watched the death scene once, so I have to see whether it came across as much as I hope, but I did a lot of flailing, kicking, and knocking things over, Malina says. I really just didnt want to go out without a fight. Yes, he drank the drink, bad call, but let him at least fight hard so that Cyrus really has to kill him. The poison is not going to do it on its own, so go out with a fight and leave an intense looking corpse. Once he took the pillow off, I had almost a smile on my face. Oh, David is finally happy  death apparently agrees with David Rosen.
