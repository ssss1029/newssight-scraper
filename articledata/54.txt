Dez Bryant might be working out with Odell Beckham Jr., but that doesn't mean he's going to be a New York Giant.
At least not yet.
Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reported the Giants "are not at this point in time vying for his services," perCharean Williams of Pro Football Talk.
The Cowboys released Bryant last week after eight seasons with the franchise. He recorded 69 receptions for 838 yards and six touchdowns, his third straight year under the 1,000-yard barrier.
Bryant said it would be "crazy" to play for the Giants in an interview with Mike Fisher of 247Sports.
"The Giants got a helluva defense," Bryant said. "They're going to pay OBJ [Odell Beckham Jr.], so coming back. Playing with him, Sterling [Shepard]... the tight end [Evan Engram], [Eli] Manning? Crazy. ... That'd be crazy."
Bryant previously told NFL Network's Jane Slater he would prefer to sign with an NFC East team because his departure from Dallas was "personal."
"I won't say any teams, but being in the division, that's a huge possibility . That's a huge possibility," Bryant said. "That's something that I want. ... It's personal. Like I said, it's very personal . I already had a plan of training and getting my mind right. I just want to do it that much more."
The Cowboys saved $12.5 million by cutting Bryant and his $16.5 million cap hit. They signed Allen Hurns earlier this offseason but do not have an obvious replacement for their top receiver on their roster.
Bryant was seen working with Beckham on Thursday in an Instagram post. Beckham is currently at an impasse with the Giants regarding a long-term contract.
When the Giants released Brandon Marshall on Thursday, it appeared they were making room on their roster for Bryant. That doesn't look to be the case at the moment.
