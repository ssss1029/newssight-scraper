South and North Korea are discussing plans to announce an official end to the military conflict between the two countries that are still technically at war, the Munhwa Ilbo newspaper reported, citing an unidentified South Korean official. Time
A photo released by the North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the state news agency of North Korea, shows a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea held on under the guidance of Kim Jong Un, chairman of the WPK and chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK, in Pyongyang, North Korea, on April 9, 2018.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Unannounced he will suspend nuclear and long-range missile tests and plans to close a nuclear test site.
The Korean Central News Agency, which is North Korea's state media agency,made the announcement as the nation's reclusive leaderis in ongoing peace talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Kim is also in negotiations to meet with President Trump.
"As the weaponisation of nuclear weapons has been verified, it is not necessary for us to conduct any more nuclear tests," Kim said at a meeting of theWorker's Party of Korea, adding "the northern nuclear test site has completed its mission."
TheKorean Central News Agency said the nation would freeze its nuclear tests and long-range missiles, specificallyintercontinental ballistic missiles on April 21.
The agency added, "the North will shut down a nuclear test site in the country's northern side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear test."
After the announcement, President Trump posted on Twitter that the move was "very good news."
"North Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site," he said. "This is very good news for North Korea and the World - big progress! Look forward to our Summit."
North Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site. This is very good news for North Korea and the World - big progress! Look forward to our Summit.
 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 20, 2018
Just days earlier,President Trump expressed a caution about theplanned meeting with Kim,explaining he would "leave the meeting" if it's not "fruitful."
While exuding confidenceabout North Korea onWednesday, Trump also raised the possibility that the yet-to-be scheduled summitmight be called off because of a lack of agreement over an agenda or that it might not be successful.
"Hopefully, that meeting will be a great success,"Trump said.
For months, North Korea's missile tests have raised concerns around the world and helped escalate a dangerous slinging of insults between Kim and Trump.

Friday's announcement of a freeze on tests and the shutdown of a facility is sure to be a step in the right direction but Trump has said he will seekan agreement in which North Korea gives up its nuclear weapons, a goal that many analysts believe will be challenging.
It's also unclear whether strings might be attached to the freeze of tests or how long this suspension might really last.
North Korea previously pledged on two occasions that it would abandon its nuclear programs. Both times it backtracked.
Tom Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told USA TODAY the North likely has a list of demands, some of which might be hard for the U.S. to meet.
The North is likely to want the U.S. to curtail joint exercises with South Korea, and to withdraw both its advanced missile defense system andnuclear equipment  includingbombers andsubmarines from the area, he said.
Currently,there are 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea, a move that followed1950-53 Korean War that ended with an armistice and not a peace treaty.
