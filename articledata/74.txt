Who is Rudy Giuliani? 01:25
Take that as a sign of what's to come. Trump prides himself on loyalty, and few people have been as devoted as Giuliani was during the campaign. He did a marathon tour on the Sunday morning talk shows just days after a leaked "Access Hollywood" tape from 2005 captured Trump making lewd statements about women -- something that kept the rest of his surrogates mum. By contrast, former Trump adviser Bannon previously claimed Chris Christie's wavering support that weekend -- weeks before the campaign -- is why he doesn't work at the White House .
So is Trump finally giving Giuliani an administration job after passing him over for the top position at the Justice , State and Homeland Security departments? There's a chance he indeed wants Giuliani to negotiate a swift end to the Mueller probe. Trump has looked for the exit sign before when things look bad, and he can surely smell blood in the water after FBI agents raided fixer Michael Cohen's properties last week.

At least one of the president's soothsayers has reportedly whispered in his ear that Cohen could flip when confronted with the prospect of jail time. His raided files are believed to hold a lot of skeletons for the President.
A mutual pal like Giuliani -- one who stood by him in the darkest hour -- might be Trump's key to ending the Mueller probe legally before it ends his presidency.
