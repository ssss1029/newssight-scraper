# Text Extraction
Text extraction done using boilerpipe.

# Settings
Most of the required settings are in `settings.py`. However, API Keys are missing. There are two ways to fix this.
 - Add a new file called `setup_environment.py` next to `main`. Fill it with the following contents:
 ```python
###########################################
#### Sets up the run environment for these modules
####
###########################################

variables = {
	"NEWS_API_KEY" : "<Your Key Here>"
	"IBM_WATSON_API_KEY" : "<Your Key Here>"
}

def getEnvironment():
	return variables
 ```
  - Add the appropriate environment variables so they can be accessed by `os.getenv()`. Use the same key/value pairs as the above code indicates.
